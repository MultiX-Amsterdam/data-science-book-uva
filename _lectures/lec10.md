# Lecture 10: Image Data Processing (Part II)

(Last updated: Jan 13, 2025)

This lecture gives a tutorial about image data processing using a Jupyter Notebook. The learning goals can be found on [this link](https://multix.io/image-data-module/).

## Preparation

Do the [preparation](https://multix.io/image-data-module/docs/preparation-image-data.html) for the image data processing module.

## Materials

Below is the link to the online notebook:
- [Image Data Processing Tutorial Online Notebook](https://multix.io/image-data-module/docs/tutorial-image-data-notebook.html)

To run the notebook, you need to follow the instructions at the beginning of the notebook to set up your Google Colab.
The Computer Vision tasks in the notebook consume a lot of computational resources.
Unless you have a good [Nvidia GPU](https://www.nvidia.com/nl-nl/geforce/graphics-cards/) with [cuda](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) installed, we recommend just using the free GPU computing unit in Google Colab to run the notebook.

## Additional Resources

Check [PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/) and the [UvA deep learning tutorials](https://uvadlc-notebooks.readthedocs.io/) for more information.
