## Preparation

Read the required course readings.

## Lecture

Below are the slides:
- [Slides for Lecture 5: Deep Learning Overview]({{ site.baseurl }}/slides/lec5-1.pdf)

## Required Course Readings

- Section 2.4.4 (Neural Networks, including 2.4.4.1 and 2.4.4.2) in the [ML4Design lecture notes](https://surfdrive.surf.nl/files/index.php/s/RyBCGg8LJ1HgXFG) (Bozzon, 2023)
- Section 10.7 (Fitting a Neural Network, including 10.7.1, 10.7.2, 10.7.3, and 10.7.4) in book [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://hastie.su.domains/ISLP/ISLP_website.pdf.download.html) (James et al., 2013). Do not worry about the chain rule math in 10.7.1 (focus on understanding why we need backpropagation).

## Optional Course Readings

- Section 5.2 (Capacity, Overﬁtting and Underﬁtting, including 5.2.1, and 5.2.2) in book [Deep Learning](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) (Goodfellow et al., 2016).
- Section 6.2 (Shrinkage Methods, including 6.2.1, 6.2.2, and 6.2.3) in book [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://hastie.su.domains/ISLP/ISLP_website.pdf.download.html) (James et al., 2013)
- Section 7.4 (Dataset Augmentation) in book [Deep Learning](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) (Goodfellow et al., 2016).
