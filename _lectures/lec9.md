# Lecture 9: Image Data Processing (Part I)

(Last updated: Jan 13, 2025)

This lecture introduces the theory for image data processing, including the convolution operation, image filtering, and convolutional neural network.

## Preparation

Read the following article and interact with the visualization to understand image filtering:
- [Image Kernels Explained Visually](https://setosa.io/ev/image-kernels/)

Read the following article and interact with the visualization to understand Convolutional Neural Network:
- [CNN Explainer: Learning Convolutional Neural Networks with Interactive Visualization](https://poloclub.github.io/cnn-explainer/)

Interact with the following website to check a live training demo using the MNIST dataset:
- [ConvNetJS MNIST demo](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/demo/mnist.html)
